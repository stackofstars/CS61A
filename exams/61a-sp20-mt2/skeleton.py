# QUESTION 1 #

"""This question involves plucking the leaves off a tree one by one.

Definitions:

1) A "number tree" is a Tree whose labels are _unique_ positive integers.
   No repeated labels appear in a number tree.

2) A "plucking order" for a number tree t is a sequence of unique positive
   integers that are all labels of t.

3) A plucking order is "valid" if both of these conditions are true:
   (a) the plucking order contains all labels of t, and
   (b) in the plucking order, the label for each node of t appears after
       the labels of all its descendant nodes. Thus, leaves appear first.

Note: redwood, pine, and cyprus are all kinds of trees.
"""

order, you can assume that:
