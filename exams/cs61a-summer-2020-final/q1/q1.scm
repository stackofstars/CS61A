;; This question is in two parts, implementing `speaker-filter` and

;; for details.

;; You need to do part (a) to run the tests for part (b).

;; NOTE: In all scheme/sql questions you can put a multi-line answer
;;    in a blank


;; Part (a)
;; A speaker-filter is similar to a normal `filter` operation, except that
;; it involves deeply filtering the given list by removing all elements
;; that *do* match the predicate.
;;
;; NOTE 1: If the entire input matches the predicate, you should not delete it
;; NOTE 2: You can assume that `pred` can be called on an element of any type
;;
;; To run tests just for this part, run
;;      python3 ok -q a
